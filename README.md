# Code Repository fore the Paper Ensemble Kalman Filter optimizing Deep Neural Networks: An alternative approach to non-performing Gradient Descent

## Description 
The Ensemble Kalman Filter(EnKF) can be used as an alternative optimizer when training neural networks, especially in cases where gradient information is not available or backpropagation not applicable.

## Prerequisites
To run the experiments please see [code/README.md](code/README.md)
